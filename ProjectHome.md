TAEMS is a Python program that computes analytical solutions for eigenmodes in rectangular, cylindrical and spherical cavities as well as the Mie series solution for the plane wave scattering of a PEC sphere. It runs on both Windows and Linux platforms and uses the wxPython wrappers to the wxWidgets toolkit for the graphical user interface component and also depends on the SciPy numerical library for some of the special functions.
